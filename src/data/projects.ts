      'I contributed to the platform\'s development, using Java for a strong and scalable backend. Working with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), I improved content management and integrated digital assets for a personalized user experience. I also implemented the Adobe Client Data Layer to track data and enhance analytics, informing our decisions. Utilizing Webpack for efficient asset management, and Optimizely for A/B testing, allowed us to continuously refine our platform and increase user engagement through data-driven insights.',
